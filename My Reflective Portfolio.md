# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio
## Week 10
### What have I learnt this week?
This week we didn’t really do much at all. But we did have a group conversation in the Zoom breakout room to discuss the peer review that we got in week 9. We also did a final allocation for our final, many-model thinking group assessment with a document on Microsoft Teams for team members to edit. Furthermore, we had a group meeting day, in order to set up the Python coding, so that we can determine each model's solution and talked with the lecturer, Juan, about our issues with it, to efficiently and effectively solve it.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week’s learning’s taught me a lot about the importance of having group meetings. If you want to plan and tackle life’s greatest adventures together, you’ve got to stay in-sync and work effectively as a team. The answer is that you’ll go deeper on the things you’re already talking about superficially in snatches. You’ll also open up on things you keep meaning to mention, but haven’t — either because you keep forgetting or because you’ve felt uncomfortable and it never seems like the right time to talk about it. We all need appreciate with the other brings to the table. 

### What insights have I gained?
The insights I gained from this week, are that we received mostly positive feedback from the group who looked at our collective work section. But yeah, minor things do need to be fixed up and polished further. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Perceived strengths:
-	Subjectively looking at the parts that need fixing up-now that we know how others perceive it
-	Communicating with the team about the feedback we received, and exclusively working on our own sections, and then inclusively looking at our collective work section

Perceived weaknesses:
-	The way the Python language works with Jupyter
-	Practicing proper time management in starting our individual sections of this final assessment, and juggling other subjects’ assessments

### What were the challenges I encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges I observed this week is to seriously reflect upon our assessment, now that we have received our peer feedback, the way forward is clear. During our Zoom call in this week, we discussed our strategies for Jupyter, and our leader, Jas designated the time for the group’s meeting. Of course, mistakes can happen in meetings like the negative power of resulting. Focusing solely on outcomes can negatively affect people’s decision-making process; as we found that it just ends up distorting everything. It’s like putting shades on. You can’t see past it. This faulty thinking has the following effects.

After they’ve made a decision, if people base the decision’s quality or “rightness” solely on its outcome, then they might misjudge what was in fact a good decision that occurred poorly due to luck. They may hesitate to continue making the same kinds of decisions based on these short-term losses, this single toss of the coin, when in the long run, over the course of many coin tosses; it would actually be to our advantage to do so. 

However, resulting also negatively impacts the process of making that initial decision in the first place. If in preparing to make a decision, you already feel 100% certain that you know the best possible outcome, then you’ll stop looking for alternative information and other options, and, seeing that your mind is made up, other people will be unlikely to share different opinions with you. You end up moving on an overly narrow, single-track course towards what you think is the desired result.

In other words, once the outcome is set by one person(the leader), their team members are going to judge whether their own ideas are right or wrong, or good or bad, based on how much they match up with the leader’s. They won’t feel comfortable sharing ideas that don’t jive with the leader’s, their thinking will default to the parameters the leader has already set in place, and at most, they’ll just says things that slightly modify what the leader has already proposed.

Leaders tend to set definitive outcomes in this manner, a lot of people think, ‘Well, in order to show my credibility to my team, in order for them to believe that I can lead them, I need to be expressing things very correctly. But in fact, people don’t always expect or even desire that leaders be sure about every single thing. But they will appreciate being able to express their opinions and ideas in an open atmosphere. So before leaders or managers hope to obtain engagement and feedback, they should consider following this simple rule: Do not share your opinion on possible solutions before asking for the team’s input on it. Simply say what the problem is and then open the floor up to others’ suggestions. By not discarding your suggestions at the start, you avoid the pitfalls that come along with resulting and outcome bias. Team members will be more likely to think outside the box and not just within the confines of their leader’s preset opinions.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is to keep on discussing my section progress with my team, the only things I can control is to focus on working to finish my section before the due date, and also look at other members’ sections to see what more needs to be improved upon. Additionally, I have to determine a workable solution to understand Jupyter and communicate that to the team. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
There were no new theories to learn from this week.
